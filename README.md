>**WARNINGS/DISCLAIMERS**

> kancolle-auto is meant for educational purposes only. Actual and prolonged use of kancolle-auto may result in your account being banned. Remember that botting is against the rules!

> I make no guarantees that you will not be caught and penalized using kancolle-auto, so be smart about it. Don't spam expeditions and sorties nonstop 24/7. Try to mimic a human as much as possible with your use of this tool! Relevant discussion can be found [here](https://github.com/mrmin123/kancolle-auto/issues/130).

> In addition, if you let kancolle-auto sortie you might lose ships! It is highly unlikely (multiple checks occur to prevent this from happening) but I make no guarantees! If you're using a viewer with subtitles, please read the 1st question and answer of the [FAQ](#faqcommon-issues)! Also, if you let kancolle-auto use buckets, make sure you can spare them!

>**NOTE**

> kancolle-auto is **not** designed to be the **fastest** automation tool. It is designed to be **robust** and **highly customizable**. kancolle-auto is meant to free up your time, energy, and attention, not to net you the most resources or XP in the shortest time possible. It can automate almost every major feature in the game, including combat, and it can run for days on end with minimal to no user intervention.

kancolle-auto was originally a fork of [these](https://github.com/amylase/kancolle-auto) [other](https://github.com/Yukariin/kancolle-auto) [projects/forks](https://github.com/kevin01523/kancolle-auto), but has since outgrown on them in scope and function. Some ideas were inspired by [another similiar tool](https://github.com/tantinevincent/Onegai-ooyodosan).

#### Quick Start

1. Install [Java JRE 7](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jre7-downloads-1880261.html)
  * [Java JRE 8](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jre8-downloads-2133155.html) also works, but you may have to edit the setup files generated by the Sikuli installer in the next step to have it properly identify Java 8
2. Install [Sikuli 1.0.x](https://launchpad.net/sikuli/sikulix/1.0.1) (not 1.1.x!) with options 2 and 5
3. Install kancolle-auto
4. [Setup kancolle-auto's config file](https://github.com/mrmin123/kancolle-auto/wiki/Setup-config.ini) ([examples](https://github.com/mrmin123/kancolle-auto/wiki/Example-configs))
5. Run Kantai Collection
6. Run kancolle-auto using command `java -jar <path_to_sikuli>/sikuli-script.jar -r <path_to_kancolle_auto>/kancolle_auto.sikuli` (replacing `<path_to_sikuli>` and `<path_to_kancolle_auto>` with the correct directories for your installs)

#### FAQ/Common Issues

**Q: Can I lose my ships using kancolle-auto?**

A: It's highly unlikely, but I can make no guarantees. There is a caveat to 'highly unlikely', however: if you're using a viewer with subtitles and those subtitles cover up ship portraits on the post-combat results screen (typically the last ship in a fleet if the subtitles are at the bottom of the screen), it can hinder kancolle-auto's ability to accurately detect ships in danger of being sunk. Either lower the subtitle's font size so that it does not cover up the results screen (I personally use a font size of 12px on KC3Kai), or disable them entirely.

You could also lose ships if you set the Combat module's LastNodePush to `True` and accidentally push into a comabt node. Hopefully the warnings in the config file will help you make the right decision regarding this flag.

**Q: Can I do other stuff on the machine/play Kantai Collection while kancolle-auto is running?**

A: Sometimes. kancolle-auto takes control of the mouse as it runs so it will be difficult to do anything meaningful while kancolle-auto is actively running. During scheduled pauses, however, you have full control of the machine. Just make sure that Kantai Collection is not in the middle of a PvP or Sortie when the schedule pause ends. The script will crash and you will have to restart the script.

**Q: kancolle-auto periodically crashes! (FindFailed errors)**

A: If you are on Windows, please try disabling time synchronization on the OS level ([relevant information](https://answers.launchpad.net/sikuli/+question/194095)). If that doesn't work, try raising the `SleepModifier` field in the config to 1, 2, or 3. If this does not reduce the number of crashes, then please open a detailed issue ticket.

**Q: I started getting catbombed frequently after I started using kancolle-auto!**

A: You probably botted too much and triggered the game's bot protection. Use the ScheduledSleep functionality and let the program pause itself for a few hours every day.
