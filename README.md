# kancolle-auto

**kancolle-auto** is a Kantai Collection expedition + combat + quest automation tool. It was originally a fork of [these](https://github.com/amylase/kancolle-auto) [other](https://github.com/Yukariin/kancolle-auto) [projects/forks](https://github.com/kevin01523/kancolle-auto), but has since outgrown on them in scope and function. Some ideas were inspired by [another similiar tool](https://github.com/tantinevincent/Onegai-ooyodosan).

**Please refer to the [releases page](https://github.com/mrmin123/kancolle-auto/releases) for stable releases, or the master branch for bleeding-edge (potentially unstable and buggy).** The [Changelog](http://github.com/mrmin123/kancolle-auto/wiki/Changelog) will have information on what's different.  Please refer to the [Setup page](https://github.com/mrmin123/kancolle-auto/wiki/Setup) for instructions on setting up kancolle-auto.
