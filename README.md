# kancolle-auto

**kancolle-auto** is a Kantai Collection expedition + combat automation tool. It was originally a fork of [these](https://github.com/amylase/kancolle-auto) [other](https://github.com/Yukariin/kancolle-auto) [projects/forks](https://github.com/kevin01523/kancolle-auto), but has since outgrown on them in scope and function. Some ideas were inspired by [another similiar tool](https://github.com/tantinevincent/Onegai-ooyodosan).

#### Features

* Expedition module &mdash; automatic expeditions
* Combat module &mdash; automatic sorties and repairs
* Ability to enable just the Expedition module, just the Combat module, or both
* Catbomb recovery
* Separate `config.ini` file for easier configuration and backup of configurations
* Random variations to hopefully make the tool more difficult to detect
* Helpful timers and other messages in console (when using sikuli-script)
