## Contributing to kancolle-auto

### General guidelines
Be courteous to yours truly (@mrmin123) and other users of kancolle-auto! This is a hobby project for a video game, so relax, have fun, and learn a thing or two about scripting or automation.

### Bug reporting / feature requests
If you've found a bug in kancolle-auto, or if you'd like to request a feature, please create a ticket on the [kancolle-auto issue tracker](https://github.com/mrmin123/kancolle-auto/issues). If you can, please search previous tickets in case your bug report or feature request was made already. Please read and follow the directions outlined in the issue template.

Due to the nature of the project and my lack of time to support everything, tangentially-related issues (including Sikuli-specific issues) may be closed without much warning.

### Code contribution
kancolle-auto was built up piecemeal and a lot of interconnected and complex logic exists all over the place. I've tried to comment the code where possible, but it wasn't possible to account for every single scenario using in-line comments. Code contribution PRs are more than welcome, but please understand that I will give it a good amount of scrutiny before I merge it in case of potentially unaccounted corner/edge-cases and resulting downstream failures.
